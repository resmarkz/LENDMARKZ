## ðŸ§® Amortization Calculation

The amortization is calculated using the standard formula for an ordinary annuity. The calculation is done in the `computeFields` method of the `LoanController`.

### Formula

The monthly payment is calculated using the following formula:

`M = P [ i(1 + i)^n ] / [ (1 + i)^n â€“ 1]`

Where:

-   `M` = Monthly Payment
-   `P` = Principal Loan Amount
-   `i` = Monthly Interest Rate
-   `n` = Number of Months

### Code

Here is the PHP code that implements the amortization calculation:

```php
private function computeFields($principal, $interestRate, $termMonths)
{
    $monthlyRate = ($interestRate / 100) / 12;

    if ($monthlyRate == 0) {
        $rawMonthlyPayment = $principal / $termMonths;
    } else {
        $rawMonthlyPayment = $principal * (
            ($monthlyRate * pow(1 + $monthlyRate, $termMonths)) /
            (pow(1 + $monthlyRate, $termMonths) - 1)
        );
    }

    $monthlyPayment = round($rawMonthlyPayment, 2);

    $totalPayable = round($rawMonthlyPayment * $termMonths, 2);

    return [
        'monthly_payment' => $monthlyPayment,
        'total_payable'   => $totalPayable,
    ];
}
```
